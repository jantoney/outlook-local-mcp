# Outlook Local MCP Server

A single-binary MCP server that connects Claude Desktop and Claude Code to Microsoft Outlook via the Microsoft Graph API. Manage your calendar, read email, and compose drafts without leaving your AI assistant.

## Install

**Go binary** (recommended):

```bash
go install github.com/desek/outlook-local-mcp/cmd/outlook-local-mcp@latest
```

**Claude Desktop extension** (no terminal required):

Download the `.mcpb` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/desek/outlook-local-mcp/releases/latest) and open it in Claude Desktop via **Settings > Extensions > Install from file**.

For full setup instructions including Claude Desktop and Claude Code configuration, see [quickstart.md](quickstart.md).

## Features

- **Calendar management** -- list, search, create, update, delete, and respond to events; create and cancel meetings with attendee confirmation
- **Multi-account support** -- manage multiple Microsoft accounts simultaneously with per-account token isolation and lifecycle control (`add`, `remove`, `login`, `logout`, `refresh`)
- **Explicit authentication** -- process-bound device code, browser, and authorization code sessions per account
- **Persistent token cache** -- OS-native secure storage (macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret, Windows DPAPI) with AES-256-GCM file fallback
- **Granular account permissions** -- independent own-calendar and own-mail actions with deterministic least-privilege scopes
- **Validated shared resources** -- manual/discovered calendars and mailboxes fail closed until direct Graph metadata validation succeeds
- **Optional local web UI** -- embedded loopback-only account and permission management on port 8155 by default
- **Read-only mode** -- disable all writes via `READ_ONLY=true`
- **In-server documentation access** -- the LLM can look up docs and troubleshoot without leaving the session (see below)
- **MCP tool annotations** -- full annotation set for Anthropic Software Directory compliance
- **OpenTelemetry** -- optional metrics and tracing via OTLP gRPC
- **Structured and audit logging** -- JSON/text format with PII sanitization and per-invocation audit trail

## Tool invocation shape (v0.6.0+)

All operations use four aggregate domain tools dispatched by an `operation` verb:

```
{tool: "calendar", args: {operation: "list_events", date: "today"}}
{tool: "mail",     args: {operation: "list_folders"}}
{tool: "account",  args: {operation: "list"}}
{tool: "system",   args: {operation: "status"}}
```

Call any domain with `operation: "help"` to list its verbs and parameters:

```
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "help"}}
```

## In-server documentation access

The server embeds its own documentation as four user-facing files: `readme`, `quickstart`, `concepts`, and `troubleshooting` (see `docs/embed.go`). The LLM can search and retrieve them directly:

```
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "list_docs"}}
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "search_docs", query: "token refresh"}}
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "get_docs", slug: "troubleshooting", section: "keychain-locked"}}
```

Each document is also exposed as an MCP resource at `doc://outlook-local-mcp/{slug}` for clients that support `resources/list` and `resources/read`. The server entry point (`system.status`) includes a `docs` section with the base URI and troubleshooting slug.

## For LLM clients

If you are an LLM consuming this server, see [llms.txt](llms.txt) for a machine-readable index of all documentation, tools, and change requests with absolute GitHub links.

## Configuration

All settings use environment variables prefixed with `OUTLOOK_MCP_`. Key variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CLIENT_ID` | `outlook-desktop` | OAuth client ID (well-known name or UUID) |
| `TENANT_ID` | `common` | Entra ID tenant |
| `AUTH_METHOD` | *(inferred)* | `device_code`, `browser`, or `auth_code` |
| `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` | `auto` | IANA timezone for calendar operations |
| `TOKEN_STORAGE` | `auto` | `auto`, `keychain`, or `file` |
| `READ_ONLY` | `false` | Disable write operations |
| `WEB_UI_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable embedded account administration UI |
| `WEB_UI_PORT` | `8155` | IPv4-loopback UI port |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `warn` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `LOG_FILE` | *(disabled)* | File path for persistent log output |

Full configuration reference is in [docs/reference/architecture.md](docs/reference/architecture.md#configuration).

## Troubleshooting

Common issues including authentication failures, token refresh, Keychain errors, Graph throttling, local UI startup, and shared-resource validation are covered in [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md). The LLM can retrieve this guide directly with `{tool: "system", args: {operation: "get_docs", slug: "troubleshooting"}}`.
